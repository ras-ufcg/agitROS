#  Severity levels

The idea of ROS’s logging system—and, for the most part, software logging in general—is
to allow programs to generate a stream of short text strings called log messages. In ROS,
log messages are classified into five groups called **severity levels**, which are sometimes
called just **severities** and sometimes called just **levels**. The levels are, in order of increasing
importance:
- DEBUG
- INFO
- WARN
- ERROR
- FATAL

The idea is that DEBUG messages may be generated very frequently, but are not generally interesting when the program is working correctly. At the other end of the spectrum,

FATAL messages are likely to be very rare but very important, indicating a problem that
prevents the program from continuing. The other three levels, INFO, WARN, and ERROR, represent intermediate degrees of importance between these two extremes. Figure 4.1 shows examples, from the ROS source, of each of these severity levels.
This variety of severity levels is intended to provide a consistent way to classify and
manage log messages. We’ll see shortly, for example, how to filter or highlight messages
based on their severity levels. However, the levels themselves don’t carry any inherent
meaning: Generating a FATAL message will not, in itself, end your program. Likewise,
generating a DEBUG message will not (alas) debug your program for you.
